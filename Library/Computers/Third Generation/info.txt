The period of third generation was from 1965-1971. The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs) in place of transistors. A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the associated circuitry.

The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable, and efficient. In this generation remote processing, time-sharing, multiprogramming operating system were used. High-level languages (FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were used during this generation.

The main features of third generation are −

IC used
More reliable in comparison to previous two generations
Smaller size
Generated less heat
Faster
Lesser maintenance
Costly
AC required
Consumed lesser electricity
Supported high-level language
Some computers of this generation were −

IBM-360 series
Honeywell-6000 series
PDP (Personal Data Processor)
IBM-370/168
TDC-316
